# deSync

deSync is a zero-interest lending protocol built on Scroll that provides unlocks lucrative yield on for lenders while allowing borrowers to borrow at 0% interest.

deSync's lending protocol, provides a crypto-native, scalable solution for yield generation achieved by delta-hedging Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDC spot assets using perpetual futures contracts.

Unlocking reliable and lucrative yields on native assets like $BTC and $ETH represents one of the most significant opportunities in the crypto industry, tapping into a trillion-dollar market.

> [!WARNING]
> deSync is not the same as a traditional lending protocol. The yield generated by deSync is synthetic, and is generated by leveraging the crypto assets in its pools and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks implicated by interacting with deSync are inherently different.

> [!TIP]
> Please refer to the [Risks](https://docs.desync.fi/risks) section in our docs for more information.
