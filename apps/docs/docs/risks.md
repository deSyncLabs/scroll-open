# Risks

## Funding Fee Risk

Given deSync uses derivatives positions, such as perpetual contracts, to hedge the delta of the digital asset collateral, the protocol is exposed to "Funding Risk." Funding risk relates to the potential of persistently negative funding rates. deSync can earn a yield from funding but may also be required to pay funding.

While this is a direct risk to the protocol yield, historic data suggests that the funding rate is almost always positive.
