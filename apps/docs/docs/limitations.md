# Limitations

## Liquidator

As we don't have comunnity run liquidators deSync Labs has to run their own liquidator. Our liquidator only runs once every few hours and cause pools to be imbalanced for some time.

## Instant Withdraw and Borrow

Users can't withdraw or borrow instantly, they need to submit an intent which can take upto 24 hours to fulfill.

We are working on implementing a buffer pool to allow users to withdraw and borrow instantly for smaller amounts.
